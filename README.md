# Path-Finder
Visualization of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on a 2D grid.

The user chooses a start and an end point and then creates boundaries on a 2D grid.
After hitting the "Enter" key, the program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between
the chosen points.

Graph.py: Contains an implementation of a graph data structure and the core of the program: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
Main.py: A Pygame GUI that represents a 2D grid and handles user interaction.
